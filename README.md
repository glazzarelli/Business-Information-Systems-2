# Business Information Systems 2 Notes

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my notes of Business Information Systems 2 held at Politecnico di Milano.

**Disclaimer:** The text from the notes are generated using GPT and Whisper-v2 from the audios of the lecturesâ‰ˆ. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, there may be errors and inaccuracies. 

## Structure

The main LaTeX file is `main.tex`. This file includes sections from external files located in the `sections` directory.

The `output` directory contains the compiled PDF document.

## Building

To compile the LaTeX document and produce a PDF I used the LaTeX Workshop extension in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the LaTeX project in Visual Studio Code and install the LaTeX Workshop extension.
2. Run the `LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. The LaTeX Workshop extension will automatically run the appropriate LaTeX tools to compile your document.
4. The compiled PDF will be displayed in a new tab in Visual Studio Code.

Please ensure that you have a Latex distribution installed and properly configured in your system.
I use the MiKTeX distribution in both MacOS and Windows.
