\section{Exam Schedules and
    Evaluations}\label{exam-schedules-and-evaluations}

Students in group two should attend the lecture, while students in group
one should study the subject and the lecture slides for the exam. Group
two students will be evaluated in class, while group one students will
have an exam based on the material covered in the lecture. Some students
from group one have asked about the midterm exam for BIS two, and the
answer is yes, there will be a midterm exam. The date for the final exam
can be found on the course schedule on the WEB platform, and it will
only cover the material from BIS two. The midterm exam for BIS one has
already taken place, and there will be a separate midterm exam for BIS
two.
During official exam dates, excluding midterms, both BIS one and BIS two
exams are usually scheduled at different times. However, starting from
September, when there are fewer students, the exams are held
simultaneously in the same room. In June and July, BIS one is typically
conducted first, followed by BIS two after an hour. I will inform you of
the specific instructions via email when the time comes.
